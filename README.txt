This add on for Property Hive assists with the layout of property pages and more.

== Installation ==

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive Template Assistant Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Once installed and activated, you can access the settings for this add on by navigating to 'Property Hive > Settings > Template Assistant' from within WordPress.
